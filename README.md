# FoodBER: *For Berliners on the go!*
Berliners are a busy bunch who want quick meals and good vibes without breaking the bank. Ever the fans of good recommendations, they cannot be arsed to spend hours going over restaurants to decide which place offers the most unique culinary experience they so desire. 

Our program allows anyone to input criteria on what cuisine they would like to try, the money they are willing to spend given the rating they demand. The program will make recommendations based on user input, providing additional information to make the choice easier for the user.
